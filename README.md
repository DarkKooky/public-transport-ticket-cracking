# [Ressources](https://github.com/DarkKooky/public-transport-ticket-cracking/tree/main/resources)
The files contain data scanned from 2 non-nominative public transport tickets by my [Flipper](https://flipperzero.one)'s NFC reader.
The file naming goes as follows: `<CARD>_<CRED>.nfc`
- `<CARD>` describes the mark I inscribbed onto the ticket to differenciate them
  - `a_8` represents ticket `a`
  - `b_0` represents ticket `b`
  - `b_1` represents ticket `b`
- `<CRED>` decribes the amount of credits held by the ticket
  - `a_8` holds `8` credits
  - `b_0` holds `0` credit
  - `b_1` holds `1` credit
