# [Ressources](https://github.com/DarkKooky/public-transport-ticket-cracking/tree/main/resources)
The files contain data scanned from 2 non-nominative public transport tickets by my [Flipper](https://flipperzero.one)'s NFC reader.
The file naming goes as follows: `<CARD>_<CRED>.nfc`
- `<CARD>` describes the mark I inscribbed onto the ticket to differenciate them
  - [b_0.nfc](https://github.com/DarkKooky/public-transport-ticket-cracking/blob/main/resources/b_0.nfc) and [b_1.nfc](https://github.com/DarkKooky/public-transport-ticket-cracking/blob/main/resources/b_1.nfc) are both scanned data from the same card
- `<CRED>` decribes the amount of credits held by the ticked
