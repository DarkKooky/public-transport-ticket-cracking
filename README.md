# [Ressources](https://github.com/DarkKooky/public-transport-ticket-cracking/tree/main/resources)
The files contain data scanned from 2 non-nominative public transport tickets by my [Flipper](https://flipperzero.one)'s NFC reader.
The file naming goes as follows: `<CARD>_<CRED>.nfc`
- `<CARD>` describes the mark I inscribbed onto the ticket to differenciate them.
